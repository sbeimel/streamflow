# Mass Regex Assignment Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This feature allows users to add a single regex pattern to multiple channels at once, significantly reducing the time needed to configure stream matching for large channel lists.

## Key Features

### 1. Table-Based Interface
The Regex Configuration section has been redesigned with a clean, modern table layout:
- **Columns**: Select checkbox, Channel #, Channel Name, Channel Group, Regex Patterns, Actions
- **Sortable**: Click column headers to sort
- **Paginated**: Choose 10/20/50/100 items per page
- **Searchable**: Filter by channel name, number, or group

### 2. Multi-Select Functionality
- Click checkboxes to select individual channels
- Use "Select All" to select all visible channels on current page
- Use "Deselect All" to clear selection
- Selection counter shows how many channels are selected

### 3. Group Filtering and Sorting
- **Filter by Group**: Dropdown to show only channels from a specific group
- **Sort by Group**: Checkbox to organize channels by group name
- Makes it easy to configure channels from the same group together

### 4. Bulk Regex Assignment
Click "Add Regex to Selected" button to:
1. Open bulk assignment dialog
2. Enter a regex pattern
3. Apply it to all selected channels at once

### 5. Channel Name Variables
Use `CHANNEL_NAME` in patterns to create reusable regex rules:

**Example**:
- Pattern: `.*CHANNEL_NAME.*`
- For channel "ESPN" becomes: `.*ESPN.*`
- For channel "CNN" becomes: `.*CNN.*`
- For channel "ABC" becomes: `.*ABC.*`

One pattern works for many channels!

**Live Preview Support**:
- The live regex preview automatically substitutes `CHANNEL_NAME` with the actual channel name
- You can see in real-time which streams will be matched when you test your pattern
- This ensures your pattern works correctly before applying it to channels

## How to Use

### Basic Workflow: Add Pattern to Multiple Channels

1. **Navigate** to Channel Configuration → Regex Configuration tab
2. **Select channels**:
   - Click checkboxes next to channels you want to configure
   - Or use "Select All" to select all visible channels
3. **Open bulk dialog**:
   - Click "Add Regex to Selected" button
4. **Enter pattern**:
   - Type your regex pattern
   - Use `CHANNEL_NAME` for channel-specific matching
5. **Apply**:
   - Click "Add to X Channels"
   - Pattern is added to all selected channels

### Advanced Workflow: Configure by Group

1. **Filter by group**:
   - Use "Filter Group" dropdown
   - Select specific group (e.g., "Sports", "News")
2. **Select all**:
   - Click "Select All" to select all channels in that group
3. **Add pattern**:
   - Click "Add Regex to Selected"
   - Enter pattern like: `.*CHANNEL_NAME.*|.*HD.*`
4. **Repeat** for other groups as needed

## Technical Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Pattern Variable Substitution
File: `backend/automated_stream_manager.py`

Added method to substitute `CHANNEL_NAME` at match time:
```python
def _substitute_channel_variables(self, pattern: str, channel_name: str) -> str:
    escaped_channel_name = re.escape(channel_name)
    return pattern.replace('CHANNEL_NAME', escaped_channel_name)
```

#### 2. Bulk Assignment Endpoint
File: `backend/web_api.py`

New API endpoint:
```
POST /api/regex-patterns/bulk
{
  "channel_ids": [1, 2, 3],
  "regex_patterns": [".*CHANNEL_NAME.*"]
}
```

Features:
- Validates patterns before applying
- Fetches channel names from UDI
- Merges with existing patterns (no duplicates)
- Returns success/failure count

#### 3. Live Regex Preview Endpoint
File: `backend/web_api.py`

Updated the `/api/test-regex-live` endpoint to support `CHANNEL_NAME` substitution:
```python
# Substitute CHANNEL_NAME variable with actual channel name
escaped_channel_name = re.escape(channel_name)
substituted_pattern = pattern.replace('CHANNEL_NAME', escaped_channel_name)
```

**Key Features**:
- Automatically substitutes `CHANNEL_NAME` before testing patterns
- Escapes special regex characters in channel names (e.g., `+`, `.`, `*`)
- Provides real-time feedback on what streams will be matched
- Works for both individual pattern editing and bulk assignment dialogs

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. New Components
File: `frontend/src/pages/ChannelConfiguration.jsx`

- Table-based layout with multi-select
- Group filtering dropdown
- Sort by group checkbox
- Bulk assignment dialog
- Selection controls (Select All, Deselect All)

#### 2. State Management
```javascript
const [selectedChannels, setSelectedChannels] = useState(new Set());
const [filterByGroup, setFilterByGroup] = useState('all');
const [sortByGroup, setSortByGroup] = useState(false);
const [bulkPattern, setBulkPattern] = useState('');
```

#### 3. API Integration
File: `frontend/src/services/api.js`

Added bulk assignment method:
```javascript
bulkAddPatterns: (data) => api.post('/regex-patterns/bulk', data)
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suites:

### 1. Mass Regex Assignment Tests
File: `backend/tests/test_mass_regex_assignment.py`

**9 Tests - All Passing**:
1. Basic channel name substitution
2. Multiple variable occurrences
3. Special regex character escaping
4. Complex pattern handling
5. Patterns without variables
6. End-to-end matching validation
7. Dot escaping in channel names
8. Pattern merge logic
9. Duplicate prevention

### 2. Live Regex Preview Tests
File: `backend/tests/test_regex_live_preview.py`

**7 Tests - All Passing**:
1. Channel name substitution in live preview
2. User-reported pattern validation
3. Special characters in channel names
4. Multiple CHANNEL_NAME occurrences
5. Patterns without variables
6. Empty channel name handling
7. Case sensitivity behavior

**Combined Results**: ✅ All 16 tests PASSED
9. Duplicate prevention

**Results**: ✅ All tests PASSED

## Security

**CodeQL Scan**: 0 alerts found
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Proper input validation
- Regex escaping prevents injection
- UDI access is secure

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing functionality preserved:
- Individual pattern editing still works
- Pattern testing interface unchanged
- Export/import patterns still functional
- Channel ordering tab unaffected
- Group management tab unaffected
- All existing patterns continue to work

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: CHANNEL_NAME shows 0 matches in live preview

**Solution**: This has been fixed. The live preview now automatically substitutes `CHANNEL_NAME` with the actual channel name before testing.

**What was the problem?**
- The live preview endpoint wasn't substituting the variable
- It treated `CHANNEL_NAME` as literal text
- Actual stream matching worked correctly, but preview didn't

**How it works now:**
- Live preview substitutes `CHANNEL_NAME` before testing
- You'll see the actual matches in real-time
- Both individual and bulk regex dialogs work correctly

### Issue: Pattern with special characters doesn't work

**Solution**: Channel names with special regex characters are automatically escaped.

**Example:**
- Channel name: `ESPN+`
- Pattern: `.*CHANNEL_NAME.*`
- Becomes: `.*ESPN\+.*` (+ is escaped)

This prevents regex errors and ensures patterns match correctly.

### Issue: Pattern works in export but not in preview

**Check these:**
1. Verify you're using the latest version with the fix
2. Make sure channel name is spelled correctly
3. Test with a simpler pattern first (e.g., `.*CHANNEL_NAME.*`)
4. Check that the channel actually exists in your setup
