      "codec": 0.10,
      "errors": 0.20
    }
  }
}
```
Updates stream checker configuration.

**Configuration Options:**
- `enabled` - Enable/disable the stream checker service
- `global_check_schedule.enabled` - Enable scheduled global checks of all channels
- `global_check_schedule.frequency` - Schedule frequency ('daily' or 'monthly')
- `global_check_schedule.hour` - Hour to run check (0-23)
- `global_check_schedule.minute` - Minute to run check (0-59)
- `queue.check_on_update` - Automatically queue channels for checking when M3U playlists are updated
- `queue.max_channels_per_run` - Maximum number of channels to check per run
- `scoring.weights` - Weights for different quality factors in stream scoring

### Get Progress
```
GET /api/stream-checker/progress
```
Returns real-time progress of current check operation.

### Check Channel
```
POST /api/stream-checker/check-channel
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "channel_id": 123
}
```
Queues a specific channel for checking with high priority.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Channel 123 queued for immediate checking"
}
```

### Check Single Channel (Synchronous)
```
POST /api/stream-checker/check-single-channel
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "channel_id": 123
}
```
Performs a complete channel refresh similar to a global check but scoped to a single channel. This operation:
- Refreshes M3U playlists for accounts associated with the channel
- Re-discovers and assigns matching streams (including previously dead ones)
- Force checks all streams, bypassing the 2-hour immunity period
- Revives streams that are now working
- Removes streams that are still dead

This is a synchronous operation that returns detailed results when complete.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "channel_id": 123,
  "channel_name": "Example Channel",
  "stats": {
    "total_streams": 15,
    "dead_streams": 2,
    "avg_resolution": "1920x1080",
    "avg_bitrate": "5000 kbps",
    "stream_details": [
      {
        "stream_id": 1001,
        "stream_name": "Stream 1",
        "resolution": "1920x1080",
        "bitrate": "6000 kbps",
        "video_codec": "h264",
        "fps": "30.0"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:** This endpoint performs the check immediately and waits for completion, while `/check-channel` queues the check and returns immediately.

### Mark Updated
```
POST /api/stream-checker/mark-updated
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "channel_ids": [1, 2, 3]
}

    "regex_pattern": "^Live:|Championship",
    "minutes_before": 10
  }
]
```
Import auto-create rules from JSON. Each rule is validated before import. Invalid rules are skipped and reported in the response.

**Request Fields:**
- `name` (required): Rule name
- `channel_ids` (required, unless `channel_id` provided): Array of channel IDs
- `channel_id` (optional): Single channel ID for backward compatibility
- `regex_pattern` (required): Regex pattern to match programs
- `minutes_before` (optional, default: 5): Minutes before program start

**Response:**
```json
{
  "imported": 2,
  "failed": 0,
  "total": 2,
  "errors": []
}
```

If some rules fail:
```json
{
  "imported": 1,
  "failed": 1,
  "total": 2,
  "errors": [
    "Rule 2 ('Sports Events'): Channel 789 not found"
  ]
}
```

### Scheduled Events Processor

### Get Scheduled Event Processor Status
```
GET /api/scheduling/processor/status
```
Get the status of the background thread that processes scheduled EPG events.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "running": true,
  "thread_alive": true
}
```

### Start Scheduled Event Processor
```
POST /api/scheduling/processor/start
```
Start the background thread for processing scheduled events. The processor checks for due events every 30 seconds using an event-based approach for better responsiveness. When new events are created, the processor wakes up immediately to check them.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Scheduled event processor started"
}
```

**Note:** The processor is automatically started when the Flask app starts (if wizard is complete).

### Stop Scheduled Event Processor
```
POST /api/scheduling/processor/stop
```
Stop the background thread for processing scheduled events.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Scheduled event processor stopped"
}
```

### Process Due Events (Manual)
```
POST /api/scheduling/process-due-events
```
Manually trigger processing of all scheduled events that are due. This is handled automatically by the background thread, but can be called manually if needed.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Processed 2 event(s), 2 successful",
  "processed": 2,
  "successful": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "event_id": "abc123",
      "channel_name": "ESPN HD",
      "program_title": "Monday Night Football",
      "success": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. The background thread checks for due scheduled events every 30 seconds using an event-based approach
2. When an event is created, the thread is woken up immediately to check for new due events
3. When an event is due (current time >= check_time), it executes a channel check
4. The channel check includes the program name in the changelog entry
5. After successful execution, the event is automatically deleted from the schedule
6. Any errors are logged but don't stop the processor

**Architecture:**
- Runs as a daemon thread in the Flask application
- Uses threading.Event for responsive wake-up (inspired by Global Action scheduler)
- Thread-safe using locks in SchedulingService
- Survives Flask reloads in development mode (daemon thread)
- Automatically starts with Flask app (when wizard is complete)
- Check interval reduced from 60s to 30s for better responsiveness

### Get EPG Refresh Processor Status
```
GET /api/scheduling/epg-refresh/status
```
Get the status of the background thread that periodically refreshes EPG data and creates scheduled events from auto-create rules.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "running": true,
  "thread_alive": true
}
```

### Start EPG Refresh Processor
```
POST /api/scheduling/epg-refresh/start
```
Start the background thread for periodic EPG refresh. The processor fetches EPG data based on the configured refresh interval (default: 60 minutes, minimum: 5 minutes) and automatically matches programs to auto-create rules.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "EPG refresh processor started"
}
```

**Note:** The processor is automatically started when the Flask app starts (if wizard is complete).

### Stop EPG Refresh Processor
```
POST /api/scheduling/epg-refresh/stop
```
Stop the background thread for EPG refresh.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "EPG refresh processor stopped"
}
```

### Trigger EPG Refresh Manually
```
POST /api/scheduling/epg-refresh/trigger
```
Manually trigger an immediate EPG refresh, bypassing the configured interval. The processor will wake up and fetch EPG data immediately.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "EPG refresh triggered"
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. The background thread starts 5 seconds after application startup
2. It fetches EPG data from Dispatcharr's `/api/epg/grid/` endpoint
3. The `match_programs_to_rules()` function is called automatically
4. Scheduled events are created for programs matching auto-create rules
5. The processor waits for the configured interval before the next refresh
6. On error, it waits 5 minutes before retrying

**Configuration:**
- Refresh interval configured via `epg_refresh_interval_minutes` in scheduling config
- Default: 60 minutes
- Minimum: 5 minutes
- Can be adjusted dynamically via configuration update

**Architecture:**
- Runs as a daemon thread in the Flask application
- Uses threading.Event for responsive wake-up
- Constants defined for timeouts and delays
- Critical error handling with graceful shutdown
- Automatically starts with Flask app (when wizard is complete)
