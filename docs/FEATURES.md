## Stream Management

### Channel Ordering Interface
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for channel organization
- **Multiple Sorting Options**:

  - Sort by ID
  - Custom manual order
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time updates with unsaved changes indicator
- **Bulk Operations**: Save all changes at once
- **Reset Option**: Discard changes and revert to last saved order

### Pipeline-Based Automation
StreamFlow offers 5 pipeline modes to match different usage scenarios:
- **Pipeline 1**: Continuous updates with 2-hour immunity (moderate connection usage)
- **Pipeline 1.5**: Pipeline 1 + scheduled complete checks (balanced approach)
- **Pipeline 2**: Updates and matching only, no automatic checking (minimal connection usage)
- **Pipeline 2.5**: Pipeline 2 + scheduled complete checks (controlled automation)
- **Pipeline 3**: Only scheduled operations (maximum control)

See [PIPELINE_SYSTEM.md](PIPELINE_SYSTEM.md) for detailed pipeline documentation.

### Automated M3U Playlist Management
- Automatically refreshes playlists every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Detects playlist changes in real-time
- Updates channels immediately when M3U refreshes
- Tracks update history in changelog

### Intelligent Stream Quality Checking
Multi-factor analysis of stream quality using a single optimized ffmpeg call:
- **Bitrate**: Average kbps measurement
- **Resolution**: Width × height detection
- **Frame Rate**: FPS analysis
- **Video Codec**: H.265/H.264 identification with automatic sanitization
  - Filters out invalid codec names (e.g., "wrapped_avframe", "unknown")
  - Extracts actual codec from hardware-accelerated streams
- **Audio Codec**: Detection and validation
  - Parses **input stream codecs** only (e.g., "aac", "ac3", "mp3", "eac3")
  - Avoids decoded output formats (e.g., "pcm_s16le")
  - Supports multiple audio streams and language tracks
- **Error Detection**: Decode errors, discontinuities, timeouts
- **Optimized Performance**: Single ffmpeg call instead of separate ffprobe+ffmpeg (reduced overhead)
- **Parallel Checking**: Thread-based concurrent analysis with configurable worker pool
  - Proper pipeline: gather stats in parallel → when ALL checks finish → push info to Dispatcharr
  - Prevents race conditions during concurrent operations

### Automatic Stream Reordering
- Best quality streams automatically moved to top
- Quality score calculation (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Configurable scoring weights
- Preserves stream availability

### Stream Discovery

- New stream detection on playlist refresh

## Quality Analysis

### Scoring Formula
**Total Score = (Bitrate × 0.30) + (Resolution × 0.25) + (FPS × 0.15) + (Codec × 0.10) + (Errors × 0.20)**

### Configurable Weights
```json
{
  "weights": {
    "bitrate": 0.30,      // Default: 30%
    "resolution": 0.25,   // Default: 25%
    "fps": 0.15,          // Default: 15%
    "codec": 0.10,        // Default: 10%
    "errors": 0.20        // Default: 20%
  }
}
```

### Codec Preferences
- H.265/HEVC preference: Higher score for modern codecs
- Interlaced penalty: Lower score for interlaced content
- Dropped frames penalty: Lower score for streams with frame drops

### Sequential and Parallel Checking
- **Parallel Mode** (default): Concurrent stream checking with configurable worker pool (default: 10)
  - Thread-based parallel execution
  - Configurable global concurrency limit
  - **Per-Account Stream Limits**: Respects maximum concurrent streams for each M3U account
    - Smart scheduler ensures account limits are never exceeded
    - Multiple accounts can check streams in parallel
    - Example: Account A (limit: 1), Account B (limit: 2) with streams A1, A2, B1, B2, B3
      - Concurrently checks: A1, B1, B2 (3 total, respecting limits)
      - When A1 completes, A2 starts; when B1/B2 completes, B3 starts
  - Stagger delay to prevent simultaneous starts
  - Robust pipeline: all stats gathered in parallel, then pushed to Dispatcharr after ALL checks complete
  - Prevents race conditions with dead stream removal
- **Sequential Mode**: One stream at a time for minimal provider load
- Queue-based processing
- Real-time progress tracking

### Dead Stream Detection and Management
Automatically identifies and manages non-functional streams:
- **Detection**: Streams with resolution=0 or bitrate=0 are marked as dead
- **Changelog Tracking**: Dead streams show status "dead" in changelog (not score:0)
- **Revival Tracking**: Revived streams show status "revived" in changelog
- **Removal**: Dead streams are removed from channels during regular checks
- **Matching Exclusion**: Dead streams are not assigned to channels during stream matching
- **Pipeline-Aware**: Only operates in pipelines with stream checking enabled (1, 1.5, 2.5, 3)

#### Dead Stream Revival: Global Action vs Single Channel Check
There is an important difference in how dead streams are handled:

**Global Action** (gives ALL dead streams a second chance):
1. **Step 1**: Refresh UDI cache
2. **Step 2**: Clear ALL dead streams from tracker (giving them a second chance)
3. **Step 3**: Update all M3U playlists
4. **Step 4**: Match and assign streams (including previously dead ones since tracker was cleared)
5. **Step 5**: Check all channels (force check bypasses immunity)
6. **Result**: ALL previously dead streams can be re-added and re-checked

**Single Channel Check** (gives dead streams for THAT CHANNEL a second chance):
1. **Step 1**: Identify M3U accounts used by the channel
2. **Step 2**: Refresh playlists for those M3U accounts
3. **Step 3**: Clear dead streams for THAT CHANNEL from tracker (giving them a second chance)
4. **Step 4**: Re-match and assign streams (if matching_mode is enabled for the channel)
5. **Step 5**: Force check all streams (if checking_mode is enabled for the channel, bypasses 2-hour immunity)
6. **Result**: Dead streams for that channel are cleared and can be re-added and re-checked

**Channel Settings Override**:
Single Channel Check respects per-channel `matching_mode` and `checking_mode` settings:
- If `matching_mode='disabled'`: Stream matching (Step 4) is skipped
- If `checking_mode='disabled'`: Stream quality checking (Step 5) is skipped
- Steps 1-3 (playlist refresh, dead stream clearing) always execute regardless of settings
- This allows users to configure channels individually (e.g., match but don't check, or check but don't match)

**Why the difference?**
- Global Action is the comprehensive system-wide operation that clears the slate and gives every stream a fresh chance
- Single Channel Check is a targeted operation that only affects the specified channel
- This ensures efficient targeted operations while respecting per-channel configuration

**When dead streams get a second chance:**
- During scheduled Global Actions (pipelines 1.5, 2.5, and 3)
- During manually triggered Global Actions
- During Single Channel Check for that specific channel
- When streams are manually re-added to channels outside of the automated system

  - Rules scan EPG automatically on every refresh
  - Creates events for matching programs without manual intervention
  - **Smart Filtering**:

- Show-specific: `^Game of Thrones|^The Mandalorian`
- Time-specific: `Monday Night Football` on specific channels

**Example Workflow**:
1. Create rule: "Breaking News" on CNN with pattern `^Breaking`
2. EPG refresh processor automatically fetches data every 60 minutes
3. Any program starting with "Breaking" automatically gets a scheduled check
4. If program name or time changes, event updates automatically
5. Check happens X minutes before program starts
6. No manual intervention required - fully automatic!
