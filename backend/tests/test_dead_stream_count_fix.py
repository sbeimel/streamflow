"""
Test to verify that dead stream count is correctly retrieved from the tracker.

This test validates that the fix for dead stream counting works properly:
- Dead streams are stored with channel_id in the tracker
- The API correctly counts dead streams for a specific channel
- Dead streams remain counted even after removal from the channel
