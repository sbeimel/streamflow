"""
Unit test to verify that queue logging accurately reports the number of channels added.

This test verifies the fix for the logging inconsistency where:
- "Added X/Y channels to checking queue" (from add_channels)
- "Queued Y channels for global check" (from _queue_all_channels)

The second log should report the actual number added, not the total attempted.
