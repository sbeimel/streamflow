Test that stream stats updates and dead stream detection happen AFTER
all parallel checks complete, ensuring proper pipeline ordering:
gather stats in parallel -> when all checks finish -> push the info.

This test verifies the fix for the concurrency issue where stream removal
from Dispatcharr channels wasn't working properly.
